This README file contains information on the contents of the
daiane layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

This layer is NOT an example of good practices. It contains personal hacks to be used only over Freescale Release.

In case you are using FSL Community BSP or pure Yocto Project or OpenEmbedded, you DONT need this layer.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.freescale.com/imx/fsl-arm-yocto-bsp.git
  branch: imx-3.14.28-7D_alpha

Patches
=======

Please submit any patches against the daiane layer using the GitHub pull request mechanism at https://github.com/angolini/meta-daiane

Maintainer: Daiane Angolini <daiane.angolini@freescale.com>

Adding the daiane layer to your build
=================================================

After follow the directions from README to download Freescale release:

$ cd sources
$ git clone  git@github.com:angolini/meta-daiane.git -b imx-3.14.28-7D_alpha

Change the bblayers to add meta-daiane, for example using:

$ cat ../sources/meta-daiane/tricks/add-bblayer >> conf/bblayers.conf

Share downloads and sstate-cache
================================

$ cat ../sources/meta-daiane/tricks/make-it-shareable >> conf/local.conf

It will set up DL_DIR and SSTATE_DIR to one comun place. It is helpful when you need to keep two release version installed in the same machine, the download and sstate-cache can be shared between each release installed
